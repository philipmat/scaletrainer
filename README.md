Scale Trainer
============

Helps you train your [modes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_%28music%29#Modern) and [scales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(music))
by giving you *configurable play-along exercises*.

Why did I write this? Learning music theory and learning to play any instrument,
inevitably leads to learning about musical modes and to practicing your scales.
Most exercises I've seen have you practice an entire scale for a given mode and key, eg *B-flat mixolydian* - 
which, by the way, is something that is considerably easier to do on piano than on guitar.
So you go up and down the keyboard or the fretboard and learn all the notes: B-flat, C, D, etc. 
That works really well for learning the notes, but I wanted something more entertaining:
practicing smaller portions of the scales, in non-sequential order, much like an actual solo 
would have them.
